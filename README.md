# eprCap
## Description
Design files and description to build a simple flowthrough EPR capillary sample chamber

eprCap is meant to enable researchers to build a simple and reliable capillary sample system for aqeous or lossy EPR samples. It is based on a 3D printed cap, that holds an inner glass capillary of 1 mm outer diameter and a protective outer tube, e.g. a recycled 5 mm quartz tube. The assembly is held together with expoxy glue.

## BOM
 - 2x EPR Capillary Glue Ferrules
 - 1x 5 mm OD quartz or glass tube
 - 1x 1 mm OD glass capillary
 - 2x 1/16" OD, 1/32" ID PTFE tubing of desired length
 - 1x Blunt needle (21G size)

## Build instructions
### Outer casing
1. Print the EPR Capillary Glue Ferrule two times.
2. Determine the length of the outer glass or quartz tube that is needed to fit in your resonator, making sure the printed parts fit into the top and bottom collet.
3. Cut the outer tube to length.
4. Mix up some 5 minute epoxy and fill the outer tube recess in both ferrules.
5. Insert the tube into the ferrules and align the assembly on a flat surface, along a straight edge (see picture, aluminum ruler) and let dry.

### Inner capillary assembly
6. Cut the 1 mm OD glass capillary to desired length, such that it does not protrude outside of the 3D printed ferrules, to prevent breakage.
7. Use a heat gun or small torch to soften the ends of the two pieces of tubing (i.e. 1/16" OD, 1/32" ID) and slide them over the 1 mm OD capillary. Upon cooling, they will be a shrink fit and suitable for low pressure operation.
8. Feed the tubing and capillary into the outer casing.
9. Mix up a new batch of 5 minute epoxy and glue the tubing/capillary assembly into the ferrules. You can add some epoxy at both ends and slide the tubing back and forth to work the glue into the ferrule hole.

10. Heat up one of the tubing ends to soften it and push it onto a blunt needle.
   
## Usage
Feed the tubing through the resonator and clamp the top and bottom ferrule using the resonator's collets. Fill the capillary using a syringe and record some spectra.
